Sirion is an MIT-licensed experimental 3D fluid solver framework. With Sirion, you can test mesh/particle-based simulation implementation, and debug your solver in real-time.

Sirion conceptually follows [Chimera](https://github.com/eilis-jung/Chimera-old), but with more updated technology (Vulkan/GLFW/ImgUI/C++17). Apart from ensuring a clear architecture for 3rd-party development, Sirion focuses on cross-platform compatibility and easy debugging experience, providing a smooth start for researchers who are not professional C++ developers.
